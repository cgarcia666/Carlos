<h1>About</h1>
- When it comes to passion for music, it gets me intrigued and energized,wanting to expirement with many tools and create "ear candy". I like most types of music and besides playing guitar and drums(mostly rock),i'm wanting to get behind the scenes of a recording. Like a magician, i create an illusion...and you won't see it coming.

<h1>Influences</h1>

- Garbage,Van Halen,Childish Gambino,Ozzy Osbourne,L7,Nine Inch Nails,Kendrick Lamar,Tupac Shakur,Daft Punk,Madonna


<h5>As a Mixer</h5>

- When it comes to mixing, i like to add lots of things while stirring the pot. I love to try out many time-based effects on lots of different instruments.Expirement with many plug-ins and taking things like vocals and giving them power or especially a unique presence in a song. I tend to get ambitious when it comes to ear candy. 


<h1>As a Recording Engineer</h1>

- I know some microphone techniques and setting up equipment for a session. As well as knowledge of signal flow.
